# OptiKey

Interact with your computer and speak using this assistive on-screen keyboard.

OptiKey can be controlled by any combination of eye movement (using eye-tracking devices*), mouse movement, keyboard presses, and mouse clicks giving everyone the ability to fully interact with a computer and communicate freely.

Licensed under the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE (Version 3, 29 June 2007). A copy of this license accompanies each install, as well as the source code (in the "Solution Items" folder).

OptiKey is nearly ready for public testing and updates will appear here.

I can be contacted here if you have any questions or would like to get involved: optikeyfeedback@gmail.com

Thanks for your interest.
