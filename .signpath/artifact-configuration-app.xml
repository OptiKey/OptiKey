  SignPath Artifact Configuration for OptiKey Pro Application (Stage 1)

  This configuration signs the main application executable before it gets packaged
  into the installer. This is Stage 1 of the two-stage signing process:

  1. Sign application EXE (this configuration)
  2. Build installer with signed EXE, then sign installer

  GitHub Actions packages artifacts as ZIP files, so the root element must be <zip-file>.
