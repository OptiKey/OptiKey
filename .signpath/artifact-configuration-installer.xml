  SignPath Artifact Configuration for OptiKey Pro Installer (Stage 2)

  This configuration signs the final Advanced Installer EXE bootstrapper
  after it has been rebuilt with the signed application executable.

  This is Stage 2 of the two-stage signing process:
  1. Sign application EXE
  2. Build installer with signed EXE, then sign installer (this configuration)

  GitHub Actions packages artifacts as ZIP files, so the root element must be <zip-file>.
