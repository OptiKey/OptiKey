1.Download HunSpell from here: https://sourceforge.net/projects/ezwinports/files/ - e.g. https://sourceforge.net/projects/ezwinports/files/hunspell-1.3.2-3-w32-bin.zip/download
	This gives you munch.exe/unmunch.exe in the bin directory.

2.Dictionaries can be downloaded from here: http://extensions.services.openoffice.org/en/search?f[0]=field_project_tags%3A157 - e.g. http://extensions.services.openoffice.org/en/project/hellenic-greek-dictionary-spell-check-and-hyphenation
	This gives you an .oxt file - open it as an archive (using 7zip for example) and extract the culture code .dic and .aff files.

3.Unmunch them: unmunch el-GR.dic el-GR.aff >> el-GR.unmunched

4.Open and inspect the unmunched file. N.B. you may have to manually open the file using the correct encoding and resave as UTF-8. Greek, for example, is gibberish when you first open the unmunched file in Sublime Text, but re-opening using "Greek Windows" encoding solves that problem.
