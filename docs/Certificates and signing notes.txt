Low cost certificate for Open Source projects; https://www.certum.eu/certum/cert,offer_en_open_source_cs.xml

Once purchased and activated etc on the website download the .cer file then install it into the local computer's (or current user's) certificate store. Also use the Certum 'Install Online' option on the certificate (this installs the private key which isn't there if you just install the .cer file manually).
Open mmc.exe and add the Certificate (Local Computer or Current User) add-in and find the certificate (it should be in Personal Certificates).
Right click on the certificate and select 'Export...'.
Check to export the private key - complete the process (including extended properties I think). Requires password and produces a .pfx file.
The pfx file can be used with the signtool.exe to sign files. Remember to timestamp while signing so the signed file is valid even after the expiry of the certificate.

N.B. With Certum you CANNOT currently renew an open source certificate. Instead you must purchase a new certificate and make sure the details match the previous certificate so that Microsoft Reputation can be built up faster (info from Certum customer services email).

FILE TYPES:
(Taken from http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2292495/what-is-the-difference-between-a-cer-pvk-and-pfx-file)
Windows uses .cer extension for an X.509 certificate. These can be in "binary" (ASN.1 DER), or it can be encoded with Base-64 and have a header and footer applied (PEM); Windows will recognize either. To verify the integrity of a certificate, you have to check its signature using the issuer's public key... which is, in turn, another certificate.
Windows uses .pfx for a PKCS #12 file. This file can contain a variety of cryptographic information, including certificates, certificate chains, root authority certificates, and private keys. Its contents can be cryptographically protected (with passwords) to keep private keys private and preserve the integrity of the root certificates.
Windows uses .pvk for a private key file. These are in a proprietary format. Some documentation is available.
You should never disclose your private key. These keys are contained in .pfx and .pvk files.

Generally, you only exchange your certificate (.cer) and the certificates of any intermediate issuers (i.e., the certificates of all of your CAs, except the root CA) with other parties.

CREATING A SELF SIGNED CERTIFICATE AND SIGNING OPTIKEY (THIS IS **NOT** HOW TO USE A CERTIFICATE AUTHORITY CERTIFICATE):
(Taken from http://stackoverflow.com/questions/84847/how-do-i-create-a-self-signed-certificate-for-code-signing-on-windows)

1.CREATE A SELF-SIGNED CERTIFICATE AUTHORITY (CA):
makecert -r -pe -n "CN=Julius Test CA" -ss CA -sr CurrentUser -a sha256 -cy authority -sky signature -sv JuliusTestCA.pvk JuliusTestCA.cer

2.IMPORT THE CA:
certutil -user -addstore Root JuliusTestCA.cer

3.MAKE A CODE-SIGNING CERTIFICATE:
makecert -pe -n "CN=Julius Test SPC" -a sha256 -cy end -sky signature -ic JuliusTestCA.cer -iv JuliusTestCA.pvk -sv JuliusTestSPC.pvk JuliusTestSPC.cer

4.CONVERT THE CERTIFICATE AND KEY INTO PFX FILE:
pvk2pfx -pvk JuliusTestSPC.pvk -spc JuliusTestSPC.cer -pfx JuliusTestSPC.pfx

5.SIGN THE EXE FILE WITH NEW PFX FILE: (Run from exe location)
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v7.1A\Bin\signtool" sign /v /f "C:\OptiKey Release Staging\Certificates\JuliusTestSPC.pfx" /p %passwd% /t http://timestamp.verisign.com/scripts/timstamp.dll "C:\OptiKey Release Staging\Binaries\OptiKey.exe"
